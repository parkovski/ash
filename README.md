# Ash - A Language Design Experimentation Shell

I'm trying to see what kinds of introspection and metaprogramming I can
accomplish by using recent compiler techniques.

- What kinds of help and program information can we provide during editing?
- What other views of the program are possible (node graph, IR, ...)?
- How well can we work with multiple different languages/type systems?
